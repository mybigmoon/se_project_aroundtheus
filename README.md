**Project Name**
Around The U.S.

**Project Description and its functionality**
This project is a model of cards about Jacques Costeau exploring the U.S, letting the users click on each card, like it, and interact through images and a small text.

**A description of technologies and techniques used**
We were able to work with different dimensions for bigger and smaller displays and screen sizes. At the same time it was very useful learning to apply all the values from Figma.
